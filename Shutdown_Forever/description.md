## Function of Virus:

save "shutdown-forever.txt" as "shutdown-forever.bat"
I havn't saved it as batch file. so that i wont run it by mistake any time. :)

DONT RUN THE BATCH FILE ,YOU WONT RECOVER BACK AFTER YOU RUN IT !!!

This should shutdown the persons computer. It shuts it off once and deletes the files needed to reboot and restart.So please, use this hack only if you have no intention of rebooting your computer again. So just be careful.
